      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <h3>
      Boating is the leisurely activity of travelling by boat, or the recreational use of a boat whether powerboats, sailboats, or man-powered vessels (such as rowing and paddle boats), focused on the travel itself, as well as sports activities, such as fishing or waterskiing.
      </h3>
      <h3>
      A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas.
      </h3>
      <h3>
      With sails that billowed in the autumnal wind, the boats sailed by. Each one was a white flag against the blue, as clean as the clouds above. Their hulls were all shades of fire, from burnt orange to crimson, and they broke the waves with a bobbing motion, white water cresting at the bows.
      </h3>
      <h3>
      If you are plan on traveling by, I’d still recommend you pack the night before so that in the morning, or the day that you plan to leave, you could just leave, and another tip I’d recommend is that, if you are driving by car with family, I’d recommend that you bring snacks for everyone to munch on for the long trip, and maybe even a movie but only for the people in the back seat.
